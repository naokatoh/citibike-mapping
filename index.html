<h2>Which Citi Bike station has more customers starting their trips? </h2>
<p class="content">
    Below are the maps that illustrate Citi Bike Station. The color difference depends on each station's number of starting and ending trips. Those with <strong class="marker-pink">pink</strong> dots have more customers starting their trips (above median), while those with <strong class="marker-green">green</strong> dots have more customers ending their trips (below median). 
</p>

<p class="content">
The dots distribution shows that there are more stations in September 2021, particularly in Inwood(Manhattan), the North Bronx, and Sunset Park, Brooklyn. According to Citi Bike, approximately 400 more stations were added between <a href="https://d21xlh2maitm24.cloudfront.net/nyc/September-2020-Citi-Bike-Monthly-Report.pdf?mtime=20201019132054" target="_blank"> 2020</a> and September 2021.
